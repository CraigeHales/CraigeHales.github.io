Hours of walking made Charles weary. He set the suitcase down in the shade of a mushroom and thought about waffles and ice cream and all the different kinds of seeds his mother kept in the pantry. Charles did not want to get his rations out before noon; he had not packed much while he was being as quiet as a mouse at 5:00 AM. So he dwelled on his thoughts a bit, then said to himself, "this is getting me nowhere!" and pressed on with his journey.
