Charles woke up with a start. The air was cooler now, and the clouds above seemed thicker. He pulled his blue coat from the satchel, and a hat as well, for he feared it might rain at any moment. He began trudging down the path, and started wondering where the path might lead. With a full stomach, he thought about where he might want to be, and how he might get there.
