Charles left home on Saturday morning. He packed a jacket and a cape and a poncho and a hat in his briefcase (the same one he carried to school on Friday with his homework and lunch), grabbed some bread crumbs and seeds from the pantry, and quietly slipped out the front door. Charles did not want to wake his Mom because she would tell him not to go. Charles was running away from home because...well, a lot of reasons, but mostly because he needed some space, away from his family! They never let him use the couch alone and made him take a bath and all sorts of things.
